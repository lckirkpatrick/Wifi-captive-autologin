# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## Introduction

WiFi Captive Auto-Login ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Data We Do NOT Collect

We are committed to privacy by design. **We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:**

- Personal information
- Location data (beyond what Android requires for Wi-Fi scanning)
- Browsing history
- Network traffic content
- User credentials or passwords
- Device identifiers for tracking
- Analytics or telemetry data

### Data Stored Locally

The app stores the following information **only on your device**:

- **Wi-Fi Network Profiles**: SSID names, match patterns, trigger URLs, and click text patterns you configure
- **App Preferences**: Your profile settings and configuration

This data is stored locally in your device's private app storage and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

### Android System Permissions

The app requires the following permissions to function:

- **Internet**: To trigger captive portal detection
- **Access Network State**: To monitor Wi-Fi connections
- **Access Wi-Fi State**: To detect connected SSID
- **Change Wi-Fi State**: To interact with Wi-Fi
- **Access Fine/Coarse Location**: Required by Android 10+ for Wi-Fi SSID access
- **Accessibility Service**: To automatically interact with captive portal pages (only for clicking "Accept" buttons)

**We do not use location data for tracking or analytics.** Location permission is required by Android's security model to access Wi-Fi network names.

## How We Use Information

The app uses stored profiles solely to:

1. Match your current Wi-Fi network against configured profiles
2. Automatically trigger captive portal pages
3. Automatically click "Accept" or "Connect" buttons on portal pages

All processing occurs locally on your device. No data leaves your device.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.** All data remains on your device.

## Data Security

- Profile data is stored in your device's private app storage
- Data is only accessible by the app itself
- No network transmission of your data occurs

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- **View**: All profiles are visible in the app's main screen
- **Edit**: Modify or delete any profile at any time
- **Delete**: Remove the app to delete all stored data

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us to have it removed.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app's support channels or GitHub repository.

## Compliance

- Google Play Store Privacy Policy requirements
- Android Accessibility Service guidelines
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles (privacy by design, data minimization)

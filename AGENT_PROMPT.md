You are building an Android app that automatically accepts captive Wi-Fi portals.

HARD REQUIREMENTS:
- Do NOT hardcode portal logic.
- Everything must be profile-driven.
- Use AccessibilityService only for UI interaction.
- Click only once per portal.
- Never rewrite existing modules.
- All work must be delivered via PRs to the dev branch.

Follow README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and WORKFLOW.md strictly.
